System design:
● job scheduler
● 1. Should be able to create jobs
● 2. Should be able to schedule and run jobs
● 3. Should be able to report failures and successes
● 4. Should be reliable and have strong guarantees about its job runs
● 5. Should be able to view logs and status of running jobs, as well as previously finished jobs
● 6. Should be able to handle when a job takes longer to run than expected (SLA)
●
● focus on fault tolerance and schema. i got hung up on the last requirement where my schema didn't really support the last req for example if a job is to be run once every 5 minutes and the first one is taking too long, 
the first job should not impact the next job running at the next scheduled time.


1. Core Requirements Recap
Create jobs (with scheduling metadata)

Schedule and run jobs repeatedly or once

Report success/failure of each run

Logs and status for running/completed jobs

Reliable, strong guarantees — no lost jobs, no silent failures

Handle long-running jobs without blocking future scheduled runs

2. Key Challenges / Design Considerations
Jobs may be scheduled periodically (e.g. every 5 mins)

If one run takes too long, next scheduled run should still start on time (no queuing behind)

Ability to detect and handle failed or stuck jobs (e.g. timeouts, retries)

Logs and status queries should be easy and performant

System should handle crashes or restarts gracefully (fault-tolerance)

3. High-Level Architecture Overview
Components:

Job Definition Store — stores job metadata & schedule

Job Run Store — stores each job execution instance, status, logs

Scheduler / Dispatcher — triggers job runs based on schedule, independent for each run

Worker(s) — execute the actual job logic asynchronously

Monitoring & Logging — track job success/failure, runtime, logs

4. Schema Design
Tables
Job (Job Definitions)
Field	Type	Description
job_id	UUID (PK)	Unique identifier
name	String	Job name
schedule_cron	String	Cron expression or interval string
command	String	Command/script to run
sla_timeout_secs	Integer	Max allowed runtime before SLA breach
created_at	Timestamp	When job created
updated_at	Timestamp	Last updated

JobRun (Job Execution Instances)
Field	Type	Description
run_id	UUID (PK)	Unique identifier for run
job_id	UUID (FK)	Refers to Job
scheduled_time	Timestamp	When this run was scheduled
start_time	Timestamp	Actual job start time
end_time	Timestamp	Actual job end time
status	Enum	PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE, TIMEOUT
logs	Text or Link	Logs or pointer to logs
retries	Integer	Number of retries
created_at	Timestamp	When run entry created

5. Handling Overlapping / Long-Running Jobs
Key idea: treat each scheduled run independently
When schedule triggers a run, create a new JobRun entry with status PENDING

Start execution asynchronously, update status to RUNNING and timestamps accordingly

The next scheduled run will also create a separate JobRun even if previous one is still running

This naturally allows overlapping runs and avoids blocking future runs

SLA Handling (Timeout detection)
Use sla_timeout_secs from job definition

A separate monitoring process periodically scans running jobs:

For each RUNNING job, check if current_time - start_time > sla_timeout_secs

If yes, mark job as TIMEOUT and trigger failure handling/retries if applicable

6. Fault Tolerance & Reliability
Persistent storage for jobs and runs (e.g. SQL or NoSQL DB) to avoid lost data on crashes

Idempotent JobRun creation to avoid duplicate runs for same scheduled_time

Retries: Keep retry count per run, policy can be configured

Distributed workers to run jobs, so one worker failure won’t block jobs

Use heartbeats or lease locks to detect worker failures and reassign jobs

Use event-driven architecture or message queues to decouple scheduler from worker

7. Viewing Logs and Status
Query JobRun table filtering by job_id, status, or time range for logs and run history

For live jobs, status = RUNNING and start_time present but no end_time yet

Logs can be stored directly or offloaded to a log system (e.g. ELK stack) with pointers in DB

Architecture Flow
1. Job Creation
User (or admin) creates a job via UI/API.

Job metadata (name, schedule, command, SLA timeout, etc.) is saved into the Job Definition Store.

2. Scheduling and Dispatching
A Scheduler service continuously evaluates job schedules (e.g., using cron or interval timers).

When the scheduled time for a job arrives, the scheduler:

Creates a new JobRun entry for that scheduled execution, with status PENDING and scheduled_time.

Publishes a job execution request event/message (e.g., to a queue/topic) or directly assigns the job run to a worker.

3. Job Execution
One or more Worker services listen for job execution requests.

Upon receiving a request:

The worker updates the corresponding JobRun status to RUNNING and records the start_time.

The worker executes the actual job command or script asynchronously.

During execution, logs are streamed or collected.

Upon job completion:

Worker updates JobRun status to SUCCESS or FAILURE.

Records end_time and stores logs or pointers to logs.

4. Handling Overlapping Runs / SLA
Because each scheduled run creates a separate JobRun entry, multiple runs can overlap.

The Scheduler does NOT wait for previous runs to complete before scheduling new ones.

A Monitoring Service periodically scans all RUNNING JobRuns:

Checks if any exceed their SLA timeout (current_time - start_time > sla_timeout_secs).

If so, marks those runs as TIMEOUT.

Optionally triggers alerts, retries, or compensating actions.

5. Fault Tolerance and Reliability
All state (job definitions, runs, logs) is persisted in a durable store (database, distributed storage).

Workers use heartbeats or leases to indicate liveness.

If a worker crashes mid-job:

The monitoring service or scheduler detects the stale RUNNING job (no heartbeat update).

Marks job as FAILURE or retries it according to policy.

Scheduler is stateless or supports leader election to avoid duplication.

Message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) decouple scheduling from execution.

6. Viewing Logs and Status
Users query the JobRun records via UI/API to see:

Status of running jobs (RUNNING)

History of completed jobs (SUCCESS, FAILURE, TIMEOUT)

Access logs for any job run
