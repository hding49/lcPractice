Designing YouTube or Netflix is a classic system design interview question. Itâ€™s a large-scale, distributed system, so the goal is not to build every detail, but to show your ability to analyze requirements, break down the problem, and design scalable, maintainable components.

âœ… Step-by-Step Approach
1. Clarify Requirements
Ask the interviewer:

Functional Requirements (FR):

Upload videos (YouTube) / Ingest content (Netflix)

Stream videos

View/watch videos

Search and browse content

Recommend videos

Like, comment, share (YouTube-specific)

Subscription (YouTube) or account access control (Netflix)

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):

High availability

Low latency video streaming

Scalability (handle millions of users and videos)

Durability (videos shouldn't be lost)

Consistency for user-related data (likes, history)

3. Key Component Deep Dive
ðŸ”¹ Video Upload + Processing
Upload Service handles file upload.

Store raw video in Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3).

Trigger Video Processing Pipeline:

Transcode video into different resolutions (240p, 360p, 720p, etc.)

Store processed formats in object storage

Extract thumbnails

Generate metadata (duration, resolution, etc.)

Use a job queue like Kafka or SQS to decouple upload from processing.

ðŸ”¹ Video Metadata Database
Store title, description, tags, category, uploader ID, timestamps.

Use Relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra).

Indexed fields: videoId, uploaderId, tags, title

ðŸ”¹ Streaming
Use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) like Cloudflare, Akamai to cache video chunks near users.

Videos are chunked (HLS/DASH) and streamed in segments.

Use manifest files to control resolution switching (adaptive bitrate).

ðŸ”¹ User Service
Manages profiles, subscriptions, history, watchlists.

Account authentication (OAuth, SSO)

ðŸ”¹ Recommendation System
Real-time and batch processing:

Collaborative filtering

Watch history

Trending videos

Use Spark/Flink for batch

Redis for fast recommendation fetch

ðŸ”¹ Search
Use Elasticsearch for indexing title, description, tags.

Support fuzzy matching, autocomplete.

ðŸ”¹ Caching
Use Redis or Memcached for:

Popular videos

Video metadata

Home feed

ðŸ”¹ Analytics & Monitoring
Track views, watch time, clicks.

Use Kafka + Hadoop/Spark for processing

Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring.

4. Scalability Considerations
Shard metadata DB by user ID or video ID

Use CDNs to scale video delivery globally

Use asynchronous processing for video handling

Use horizontal scaling for stateless services (API, auth, search)

5. Bottlenecks & Trade-offs
Video processing is heavy: use cloud-native transcoding (AWS MediaConvert)

Latency vs. consistency: cache heavily for performance but keep source of truth in DB

Storage cost: videos are huge; compress and store cold videos in low-cost tiers

Bonus: Multi-region deployment (Netflix)
User closest to CDN edge gets video

DB replication across regions (eventual consistency for some data)
