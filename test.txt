你可以这样组织你的对话，让它既自然又有策略性，既能表达你对职业发展的兴趣，也能让老板意识到你有晋升的意愿。

开场
"I’d love to take some time in our 1-on-1 to discuss my career development and growth within the team. I really appreciate the opportunities I’ve had so far and want to get your perspective on how I can continue to progress."

表达对成长的兴趣
"Over the past [X months/years], I’ve taken on increasing responsibilities, such as [mention key contributions or leadership moments]. I really enjoy contributing at a higher level, and I’d like to get your advice on what skills or areas I should focus on to prepare for more responsibilities in the future."

暗示晋升意愿
"I’m very interested in growing into a more impactful role. From your perspective, what qualities or achievements do you think are key for someone moving into a [next-level role, e.g., senior software engineer, tech lead] in our team?"

询问具体建议
"I’d love to hear your thoughts on what steps I can take in the next 6-12 months to position myself for that kind of opportunity. Are there specific projects, skills, or leadership opportunities you’d recommend I focus on?"

这种表达方式不会显得过于直接要求升职，而是展现你的成长心态和长期投入，这样老板会更愿意给你建议，同时意识到你的晋升意愿。

侧面暗示晋升意愿
"Since I’ll be moving to a new team, I’d like to understand how career progression works across teams. From your perspective, what are the key qualities or achievements that would position me well for a more senior role in the future?"

"If I continue to develop my skills in areas like [technical leadership, cross-team collaboration, etc.], what do you think would be the best way to demonstrate readiness for the next step?"

询问具体建议（以及如何在新团队延续晋升的机会）
"Since you have a broader view of the organization, do you have any advice on how I can continue building on what I’ve done here to position myself for future growth in my new team?"

"Would you recommend any particular projects, skills, or leadership opportunities that would help me make that transition smoothly and also prepare for more responsibility?"

结尾：表达感谢 & 保持联系
"I really appreciate all the feedback and guidance you’ve given me, and I hope to stay in touch. If you have any further advice or insights in the future, I’d love to hear them."

这样，你既能表达对现在老板的感谢，也能在离开前获取关于职业发展和晋升的建议，同时在新团队里继续推进你的职业目标。
